# TimeSeriesAnomalyDetection_Stats
The challenge in this project :
We need to build one model that should fit various time series with different characteristics. It is a
challenging problem due to sparse occurrence of anomalous events, inconsistent behavior of
different type of anomalies and imbalanced available data.
To solve this problem, we developed a pipeline that starts by an Exploratory data analysis that
highlights the importance of smoothing the signal and that the choice of the window is important,
then data transformation, then models testing.
